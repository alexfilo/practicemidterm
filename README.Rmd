#### 1.  Map the delay by destination.
  
  Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Hereâ€™s an easy way to draw a map of the United States.  You are welcome to use this code or some other code. 

```{r} 
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

airports %>%
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()
```

You might want to use the size or colour of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

```{r}

flights
planes
airlines
airports
weather

flights_average_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T)) %>%
  rename(average_delay = `mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T)`)

flights_average_delay %>% 
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  semi_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = average_delay)) +
  coord_quickmap()


```

#### 2.   Do planes trade ownership?

You might expect that there's an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Explore this conjecture using data. (Let's assume that the tail number of a plane does not change.)

```{r}
flights %>%
  select(-c(year:arr_delay , origin:time_hour, flight)) %>%
  right_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  right_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  ggplot(aes(engines, seats)) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~name)
```
```{r}
flights %>%
  select(-c(year:arr_delay , origin:time_hour, flight)) %>%
  right_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  right_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, type)) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~name)
```
It's clear that certain aspects of a plane (seats, number of engines, year, type of plane) are related to what the carrier of the plane is

#### 3a.  Plane's average speed.

Notice that ```flights$air_time``` is in minutes.  Make a new column that is the air time in hours. 

```{r}
flights %>% mutate(air_time_hours = air_time / 60) 
```

#### 4b. Average speed

For each flight, compute the average speed of that flight (in miles per hour).  Then, for each plane, compute the average of those average speeds. Display it in a histogram. You can use a base R histogram ```hist``` or ggplot's ```geom_histogram```. 

```{r}
flights   %>% mutate(
    air_time_hours = air_time / 60,
    speed = distance / air_time_hours) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(mean(speed, na.rm = T)) %>%
  rename(speed = 'mean(speed, na.rm = T)') %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(speed))
```

#### 5. Bonus

Make a table where each row is a destination, each column is a carrier, and each element is the number of times that the carrier has flown to that destination.  Ensure that you only count flights that arrived at the destination. 

```{r}
UA_bonus <- flights %>%
  filter(carrier == "UA", !is.na(arr_delay)) %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

  filter(carrier == "AA", !is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
